3. **SQL Optimization** - Best practices for writing optimized SQL queries for large datasets.

More projects coming soon!

### PySpark Data Cleaning Project
This project demonstrates how to clean and transform ride-sharing data using PySpark. It handles:
- Missing values (e.g., filling null values for ratings, payment methods, etc.)
- Invalid fare amounts (setting negative values to zero)
- Driver name cleaning (removing special characters and extra spaces)
- Standardizing payment methods and handling missing dates

## Technologies Used
- PySpark
- Databricks
- Azure Data Factory (for pipelines)
- SQL and NoSQL databases
